"# azurefunctionsdemo" 

This project was done to create a demo with <b>Azure Functions</b> and <b>Docker</b> over the standard template and adding a <i>custom</i> method called <i>isCatPlaying</i>. This function is a <i>HttpTrigger</i> and is called when you access to the url. The method <i>isCatPlaying</i> returns a custom text on screen.
